# This file contains functions for detecting and marking temporal 
# inconsistencies in reconciliattions. It uses depth first search to find 
# cycles in graphs that represent temporal relationships between nodes in the 
# parasite and host trees. When temporal inconsistencies are found, the 
# reconciliation is updated to mark which transfers are guilty of causing
# temporal inconsistencies. The main function in this file is 
# detectCyclesWrapper, and the rest of the functions are helper functions 
# that are used by detectCyclesWrapper.
