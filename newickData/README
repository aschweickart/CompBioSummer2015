Each file holds the results of running the K-Means clustering on the data-set
indicated by the filename.

For each value of K the mean distance from reconciliation to cluster
representative is given, along with the maximum distance from reconciliation
to cluster representative. This pair of values is given once for each
time it occured during the algorithm (A singe line indicates that KMeans did
not move the cluster representatives at all, 2 lines indicates that KMeans
stabilized after 1 change, etc.).

I.E.

k = 1
25.0 30.0
k = 2
22.0 26.0
21.5 25.0


This means we ran KMeans with k \in \{1, 2\}.
For k = 1 the representative was already optimal. For k = 2 KMeans change the
representatives once, improving mean radius by 0.5.
