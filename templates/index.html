           <font face="futura">DTL-RnB</font> (Reconciliation Browser) is a tool for browsing the potentially large landscape of maximum parsimony reconciliations (MPRs) of pairs of phylogenetic trees (e.g., species tree and gene trees or host and parasite trees).  This tool is based on algorithms and techniques described in the paper “DTL-RnB: Algorithms and Tools for Summarizing the Space of DTL Reconciliations” by Weiyun Ma, Dmitriy Smirnov, Juliet Forman,  Annalise Schweickart,  Carter Slocum, Srinidhi Srinivasan, and 
            Ran Libeskind-Hadas.

            <font face="futura">DTL-RnB</font> takes as input a pair of undated phylogenetic trees in <a href="/documentation">newick format along with their tip associations </a>.  <font face="futura">DTL-RnB</font> prompts the user for non-negative costs for  duplication, transfer, and loss costs (speciations are assumed to be null events and are set to cost zero) and a method for scoring events (see “Event Scoring Below”).  The tool then displays a sequence of maximum parsimony reconciliations that, collectively, come close to maximizing the total sum of the scores of the events with respect to the given scoring function.  For example, if all events have unit scores, then the tool seeks to find a small set of maximum parsimony reconciliations that include as many events as possible from the set of events found in all maximum parsimony reconciliations for the given input.

            <p class="big"> More formally, <font face="futura">DTL-RnB</font> seeks to solve the following <em>k-Reconciliations Cover Problem</em>:  
            <br>
            <b>Input:</b>  A pair of phylogenetic trees, a mapping between the tips of the trees, DTL event costs, a scoring function that assigns a non-negative score to each event in found in any maximum parsimony reconciliation, and a parameter <em>k</em>.
            <br>
            <b>Output:</b> A set of <em>k</em> maximum parsimony reconciliations that maximize the sum of the event scores. (Note that an event score is only counted once in this sum, but the same event may still appear in more than of the <em>k</em> maximum parsimony reconciliations.) 
            <br>
            </p>
            <p class="big"> 
            Although we have shown that this problem is NP-complete, <font face="futura">DTL-RnB</font> uses a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that is guaranteed to find solutions that are within 1 - 1/e (approximately 0.632) times optimal.  In other words, if the optimal solution could “collect” OPT points using <em>k</em> maximum parsimony reconciliations, our algorithm will collect at least 0.632 OPT points.  The algorithm is based on an existing approximation algorithm for the Maximum Coverage Problem.

          <h3> Scoring Functions </h3>

            <p class="big">
            <font face="futura">DTL-RnB</font> currently supports three scoring functions, although many others are possible and can be added by modifying the available source code.

                <b>Unit:</b> Each event in the reconciliation graph has a score of 1.  Thus, the kRCP problem seeks to find <em>k</em> reconciliations that include as many events as possible in the space of MPRs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Frequency:</b> Each event in the reconciliation graph is scored by its frequency, namely the number of MPRs that contain that event divided by the total number of MPRs.  
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Region-Based:</b> This function scores each event with its robustness with respect to perturbations in event costs using our <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~xscape"><font face="courier">Xscape</font></a> tool. 
                The underlying idea is that an event that occurs in many MPRs in a specified range of “nearby” event costs should have a high score and one that occurs in fewer MPRs in that range should have a lower score.  Since event costs are unit-less, we assume that the cost of duplication is normalized to 1 and the cost of transfer and loss are relative to this normalized duplication cost.  Given an original set of DTL event costs (1, T, L), we first compute the space of MPRs using xScape.  Next, given two parameters x and y, we compute the regions for transfer costs ranging from T - x to T + x and for loss costs ranging from L - y to L+y.  For each such region, we compute the set of events that arise in the MPRs in that region.  Then, for each event, its score is the total number of regions that contain that event.  Finally, we normalize scores to be between 0 and 1.  Ultimately, a score of 1 indicates that this event occurs in at least one MPR in every region in the given range whereas a score close to 0 indicates that the event occurs in relatively few other regions.  Note that this scoring function assigns a strictly positive cost to every event  since every event occurs in some reconciliation in the region corresponding to the original event costs.
