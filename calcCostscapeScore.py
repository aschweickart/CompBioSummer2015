# This file contains functions for calculating scores for events in the 
# DTLReconGraph based on their frequency among the different regions of 
# costscape. The score for each event is the fraction of regions in costscape 
# in which the event appears. The main function is newScoreWrapper, and the 
# other functions are helper functions for newScoreWrapper.
